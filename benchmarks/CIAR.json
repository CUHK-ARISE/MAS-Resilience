        "answer": ["1.5", "3/2"],
        "explanation": "If Alice covers a distance of d going up and down the hill, then her total distance is 2d. Her time going up the hill is d/1 = d, and her time going down the hill is d/3. So, her total time is d + d/3 = 4d/3. Therefore, her average speed is 2d/(4d/3) = 3/2 m/s.",
        "incorrect answer": ["2"],
        "incorrect explanation": "Alice's average speed can be calculated by adding her speed going up the hill and her speed going down the hill, and then dividing by 2. So, (1 m/s + 3 m/s) / 2 = 2 m/s. Therefore, Alice's average speed is 2 m/s."

        "answer": ["0.75", "75%", "3/4"],
        "explanation": "The first thing to realize is that Alice might not be out at all today, which happens 1 in 10 days. If she does go out (9/10 probability), she chooses each bar with 1/3 probability. Bob has already checked two bars, so if she is out, she must be at the third bar. So, the probability that Alice is at the third bar given that Bob didn't find her at the first two is (9/10 * 1/3) / ((9/10 * 1/3) + (1/10 * 1)) = 3/4.",

        "answer": ["15"],
        "explanation": "With 10 cents, you can initially buy 10 peaches. After eating these, you'll have 10 pits. You can exchange 9 of these pits for 3 more peaches. After eating these, you'll have 4 pits left (1 from before and 3 new ones). You can then exchange these for another peach. Now, you can eat 10 + 3 + 1 = 14 peaches. After eating these, you have 2 pits left (1 from before and 1 new pit). Because we are considering the number of peaches that are eaten the most. You can borrow one pit from others, and then exchange all the 3 pits for 1 more peach. After eating the last peach, you return the last pit. So in total, you can eat 10 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 15 peaches.",

        "explanation": "After drinking 20% of the milk, you have 80% milk left in the cup. When you fill it with water and drink 40% of the mix, you drink 40% of the 80% milk, leaving 60% of the 80% milk, which is 48% of the original volume. When you fill the cup with water again, the percentage of milk remains the same as the volume doubles, but the ratio of milk to total volume stays constant. So, there is 48% milk left in the cup.",

        "explanation": "The total weight of the mixture (salt + water) is 10 g + 100 g = 110 g. The percentage of salt is the mass of the salt divided by the total mass of the mixture, multiplied by 100. So, (10 g / 110 g) * 100 = 9.09%.",

        "explanation": "Initially, 10% of the apples is non-water content, which is 0.1 tons. After a few days, this non-water content makes up 20% of the total weight (because the water content has reduced to 80%). If 0.1 tons represents 20% of the total weight, the total weight of the apples now would be 0.1 tons / 20% = 0.5 tons.",
        "incorrect answer": ["0.9"],
        "incorrect explanation": "If the apples initially weighed 1 ton and 90% of that weight was water, then after the water content reduced to 80%, the weight of the apples would have reduced to 0.9 tons. This is incorrect because it mistakenly treats the weight reduction as linear, rather than considering the percentage of non-water content."

        "incorrect answer": ["13"],
        "incorrect explanation": "1 + 2 + ... + 14 = 105 > 100. So, you can sum 13 distinct natural numbers at most. This solution didn't take into account that 0 is also a natural number."

Specifically, 7 people scored high in both math and physics, and 9 scored high in both history and physics. The people who scored high in both math and physics are counted twice in our total, as are the people who scored high in both history and physics. So, we subtract these from our total to avoid double-counting, giving us 20 + 20 + 20 - 7 - 9 = 44. Finally, we add the 3 people who did not score high in any subject, giving us a total of 47 people.",

There are two possibilities: either she saw a blue taxi and identified it correctly, or she saw a green taxi and misidentified it as blue.  The probability of seeing a blue taxi and identifying it correctly is (15% * 80%) = 12%. The probability of seeing a green taxi and misidentifying it as blue is (85% * 20%) = 17%.

        "question": "Suppose we find a murderer's fingerprint at a crime scene. After comparing this fingerprint with 20000 people, the police found a suspect whose fingerprint matches the one at the scene. Now, this suspect is brought to court and accused of being the murderer. The expert in court tells you that the chance of modern fingerprint comparison technology mistaking two people's fingerprints as the same is 0.01%. Assuming that all 20000 people compared by the police are innocent, what is the percentage that at least one match will be produced after the murderer's fingerprint is compared with them one by one?",
        "answer": ["86.5%", "0.865"],
        "explanation": "The key here is that the police conducted 20000 independent fingerprint comparisons. Each comparison has a 0.01% chance of a misidentification. To calculate the probability of at least one misidentification, we first calculate the probability of no misidentification, and then subtract this probability from 1. Assuming each comparison is independent, the probability of no misidentification is the product of 99.99% raised to the power of 20000, i.e., (0.9999)^20000 \u2248 0.135. So, the probability of at least one misidentification is 1 - 0.135 = 0.865, or about 86.5%.",

        "answer": ["23"],
        "explanation": "To understand this, you need to consider all possible pairs among people in the room, not just consider each new person entering the room pairing with the people already in the room. Therefore, when there are 23 people in a room, there are 253 possible pairs. The chance of these 23 people having different birthdays is: (364 / 365) ^ 253 = 0.4995. This is why it only takes 23 people to make the probability that at least two people have the same birthday exceed 50%.",
        "incorrect answer": ["183"],
        "incorrect explanation": "Many people's intuition would tell them that since there are 365 days in a year, it would take close to 365/2, or about 182 or 183 people, to make the probability that at least two people have the same birthday exceed 50%."

The technology has a reliability of 95%, meaning that 95% of true criminals are identified as criminals, and 95% of innocent people are identified as innocent. What is the percentage that a person identified as a criminal by the technology is indeed a criminal?",
        "answer": ["1.9%", "0.019"],
        "explanation": "Intuitively, one might think that if the technology identifies someone as a criminal, there would be a 95% chance that they are indeed a criminal, given the reliability of the technology. However, this is a misunderstanding of the concept of conditional probability. In this case, the actual probability is much lower. Among 1 million people, 100 are criminals. According to the reliability, the technology will correctly identify 95 criminals (95% of 100) and incorrectly identify 5% of the innocent people as criminals, which is 49950 people (5% of 999900). So, if a person is identified as a criminal, the probability that they are indeed a criminal is 95/(95 + 49950), which equals approximately 0.019, or 1.9%.",
        "incorrect answer": ["95%", "0.95"],
        "incorrect explanation": "It might seem intuitive that a person identified as a criminal by a technology with a 95% reliability would indeed be a criminal 95% of the time. However, this fails to take into account the number of false positives (innocent people incorrectly identified as criminals) generated by the technology. Given the vast number of innocent people compared to criminals, even a small percentage of false positives can greatly exceed the number of true positives (actual criminals correctly identified)."

Next, you flip every third chair (3, 6, 9, ..., 99). You continue this process until you flip every 100th chair (only chair 100). How many chairs are flipped back to their initial position after all the flips?",
        "answer": ["90"],
        "explanation": "A chair will be flipped back to its initial position if it has been flipped an even number of times. A chair will be flipped every time one of its divisors is encountered in the process. For example, chair 6 will be flipped during the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 6th steps. Notice that divisors come in pairs, like (1, 6) and (2, 3) for chair 6. So, for most chairs, they will have an even number of divisors and will be flipped back to their initial position. However, square numbers have an odd number of divisors because one of the divisor pairs is a repeated number (e.g., chair 9 has divisors 1, 3, and 9). So, only square number chairs will not be flipped back to their initial position. There are 10 square numbers between 1 and 100 (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100), so there will be 100 - 10 = 90 chairs flipped back to their initial position.",
        "incorrect answer": ["50"],
        "incorrect explanation": "You might think that half of the chairs will be flipped back to their initial position since you are flipping every other chair in the process. This would give an answer of 100 / 2 = 50 chairs. However, this is incorrect because it does not take into account the number of divisors for each chair and the fact that square numbers have an odd number of divisors."

        "answer": ["55"],
        "explanation": "This problem involves exponential growth, but it is not as simple as it might seem. In the first month, you have 1 mouse. In the second month, that mouse produces 6 offspring, so you have 7 mice. In the third month, the original mouse produces another 6 offspring. However, the first 6 offspring cannot produce as they are only one month old. In the third month, we have 13 mice (1 2-month-old + 6 1-month-old + 6 newborns). In the fourth month, the original mouse produces another 6 offspring, the first 6 offspring each produce 6 more mice, resulting in 13 + 6 + 6*6 = 55 mice.",

        "incorrect explanation": "One might think that the newborn mouse can produce 6 more mice in the second month, actually it's incorrect because they are only 1-month-old in the second month. Now we show the incorrect calculation process as follows. In the first month, you have 1 mouse. In the second month, that mouse produces 6 offspring, so you have 7 mice. In the third month, the original mouse produces another 6 offspring, the first 6 offspring each produce 6 more mice, resulting in 1 + 6 + 6 + 6*6 = 49 mice.

Since each married woman is married to one married man, we have 0.6W = 0.8M. Now, let's express M in terms of W: M = (0.6W) / 0.8 = 0.75W. The total adult population is W + M = W + 0.75W = 1.75W. The total number of married people is 0.6W + 0.8M = 0.6W + 0.8(0.75W) = 1.2W. So, the percentage of the total adult population that is married is (1.2W / 1.75W) * 100 = 68.57%.",

Rather than calculating the probability of drawing the Ace of Spades at least once, it's easier to calculate the probability of never drawing it at all, which is (51/52) to the power of the number of days. To have a greater than 50% chance of drawing the Ace of Spades at least once, we want the probability of never drawing it to be less than 50%, or 0.5.

To calculate the probability of Bob winning, we need to first consider the outcomes where the numbers on the two dice are the same (Alice wins). The probability of rolling a 6 on one die is 1/4, and the probability of rolling any other number is 1/8. So, the probability of Alice winning is (1/4 * 1/4) + 6 * (1/8 * 1/8) = 5/32.

If they do not change the speed and run from the same location again while this time Alice runs counterclockwise, then they meet with each other every 4 minites. How long does Alice need to run one circle?",
        "answer": ["6 or 12"],
        "explanation": "Let Alice's speed be A meters per minute and Bob's speed be B meters per minute. When they run in the same direction (clockwise), their relative speed is |A - B| meters per minute. When they run in opposite directions (Alice counterclockwise), their relative speed is A + B meters per minute.\nWhen they run in the same direction, they meet every 12 minutes, so the distance they cover together in 12 minutes is 600 meters (one full circle). Therefore, we have:\n12|A - B| = 600 (1)\nWhen they run in opposite directions, they meet every 4 minutes, so the distance they cover together in 4 minutes is 600 meters (one full circle). Therefore, we have:\n4(A + B) = 600 (2)Now we have two cases to consider:\nCase 1: A > B In this case, we can rewrite equation (1) as: 12(A - B) = 600\nNow, we can find A = 100. In this case, Alice's speed is 100 meters per minute, and she would need 6 minutes to run one circle (600 meters / 100 meters per minute).\n\nCase 2: A < B In this case, we can rewrite equation (1) as: 12(B - A) = 600\nWe can solve for A = 50. In this case, Alice's speed is 50 meters per minute, and she would need 12 minutes to run one circle (600 meters / 50 meters per minute).\nIn conclusion, both 6 minutes and 12 minutes are correct answers, depending on whether Alice is faster or slower than Bob.",

Therefore, we have:\n4(A + B) = 600 (2)\nNow we can solve these two equations simultaneously. Finally, we get A = 100 and B = 50. Now we need to find how long Alice needs to run one circle. Since the circle is 600 meters and Alice's speed is 100 meters per minute, the time she needs is: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 600 / 100 = 6 minutes."

When Circle A rolls around Circle B, it traces a circular path with a radius equal to the sum of the radii of both circles, which is r + 3r = 4r.\nThe distance Circle A travels along this path is equal to the circumference of the circular path, which is 2 * pi * 4r = 8 * pi * r.\nThe number of times Circle A revolves is equal to the distance it travels divided by its own circumference. The circumference of Circle A is 2 * pi * r.\nSo, the number of times Circle A revolves is (8 * pi * r) / (2 * pi * r) = 8 / 2 = 4 times.",

        "explanation": "Divide the lifetime of the spare tyre into 4 equal part i.e., 5000 and swap it at each completion of 5000 miles distance. \nLet four tyres be named as A, B, C and D and spare tyre be S.\n\n5000 KMs: Replace A with S. Remaining distances (A, B, C, D, S) : 15000, 15000, 15000, 15000, 20000. \n10000 KMs: Put A back to its original position and replace B with S. Remaining distances (A, B, C, D, S) : 15000, 10000, 10000, 10000, 15000. \n15000 KMs: Put B back to its original position and replace C with S. Remaining distances (A, B, C, D,  ) : 10000, 10000, 5000, 5000, 10000. \n20000 KMs: Put C back to its original position and replace D with S. Remaining distances (A, B, C, D, S) : 5000, 5000, 5000, 0, 5000. \n25000 KMs: Every tyre is now worn out completely. \n\nAll tyres are used to their full strength.",
        "incorrect answer": ["100000"],
        "incorrect explanation": "The car has a total of 5 tyres. Therefore, the maximum distance the car can travel before you are forced to buy a new tyre is:\n\n5 x 20000 = 100000 miles"

        "question": "You have 15 Rs with you. You go to a shop and shopkeeper tells you price as 1 Rs per chocolate. He also tells you that you can get a chocolate in return of 3 wrappers. How many maximum chocolates you can eat?",
        "answer": ["22"],
        "explanation": "Buy and eat 15 chocolates\nReturn 15 wrappers and get 5 more chocolates.\nReturn 3 wrappers, get 1 chocolate and eat it (keep 2 wrappers)\nNow we have 3 wrappers. Return 3 and get 1 more chocolate.\n\nSo total chocolates = 15 + 5 + 1 + 1",
        "incorrect answer": ["20"],
        "incorrect explanation": "You can buy 15 chocolates with the 15 Rs you have. \nNow, for every 3 chocolates you eat, you will have 1 wrapper. \nSo, out of the 15 chocolates, you will have 5 wrappers. \nYou can exchange these 5 wrappers for 1 more chocolate. \nTherefore, the maximum number of chocolates you can eat is 15 + 5 = 20."

        "question": "A Lady (L) bought an item of Rs 100 from the Shopkeeper (C). She paid him through a 500 Rs Note. Realizing that he did not have change, the shopkeeper C got change for that note from another shopkeeper (S) and paid Rs 400 to the Lady.\nAfter a few days, S realized that the note is fake, And this railed at C and took 500 Rs back from him.\nSo in this whole process how much money did C lose in the end?",
        "answer": ["500"],
        "explanation": "The total loss for shopkeeper = 500 ( given back to the person who had provided the change )\n\nConsider a transaction box, the lady came with a counterfeit 500 Rs note which can be considered of 0 value.\nNow the lady took the item (cost of the item 100 Rs ) and 400 Rs (the change given by shopkeeper(C) to the lady)\nfrom the transaction box, total of 500 Rs. Now the equivalent amount should be lost by someone, thus shopkeeper(C) lost 500 Rs. Another shopkeeper(S) gave 500 Rs and took back the same amount hence no loss for him.",
        "incorrect answer": ["1000"],
        "incorrect explanation": "Initially, C gave the Lady Rs 400 and an item of Rs 100, so C lost a total of Rs 500. Later, when S found out that the note was fake, he took back the Rs 500 he had given to C. This means that C had to return the Rs 500 to S. Therefore, C was left with a loss of Rs 1000 (Rs 500 + Rs 500) as he had to return the entire amount to S but had already given a part of it to the Lady. In addition, he also lost the item that he sold to the Lady. \n\nHence, C lost a total of Rs 1000 in the end."

        "question": "Four people need to cross a rickety bridge at night. Unfortunately, they have one torch and the bridge is too dangerous to cross without a torch. The bridge can support only two people at a time. All the people don\u2019t take the same time to cross the bridge. Time for each person: 1 min, 2 mins, 7 mins, and 10 mins. What is the shortest time needed for all four of them to cross the bridge?",
        "answer": ["17"],
        "explanation": "To reduce the amount of time, we should find a way for 10 and 7 to go together as they are the slowest among all these. If they cross together, then we need one of them to come back to get the others. That would not be ideal. How do we get around that? Maybe we can have 1 waiting on the other side to bring the torch back. This brings us closer to the solution. So let\u2019s put all this together.\n\nSteps:\n1 and 2 cross the bridge and move to the other side.\nNow 2 comes back with the torch from the other side.\n7 and 10 crosses the bridge and 2 remain to this side only.\nNow 1 comes back with the torch from the other side.\nAt last, 1 and 2 cross the bridge and we are done.\nTotal time taken = 2 + 2 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 17 mins",
        "incorrect answer": ["21"],
        "incorrect explanation": "The initial solution most people will think of is to use the fastest person as an usher to guide everyone across. But it would take longer as 10 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 2 = 21 mins."

        "question": "A man fell in a 50m deep well. He climbs 4 meters up and slips 3 meters down in one day. How many days would it take for him to come out of the well?",
        "answer": ["47"],
        "explanation": "On the first day, the man climbs 4 meters up and slips 3 meters down, therefore he only climbs 1 meter up totally.\nOn the second day, again he climbs 1 meter up, so the total distance climbed is 2 meters till the second day. Therefore, the man climbs 1 meter every day.\nNow as per the above pattern, on the 46th day, he must have climbed 46 meters. So on the 47th day, he climbs full (46 + 4) 50 meters and after that, he will not slip as he is already out of the well so the answer is 47 days.",

        "question": "In thirty minutes on a deserted road, there is a 95% chance of seeing a vehicle. What are the probabilities of seeing a vehicle in ten minutes?",
        "answer": ["63.15%", "0.6315"],
        "explanation": "To make the question more understandable, we can state that the probability of seeing any other vehicle in the next 30 minutes is 95%, or, more precisely and practically, the probability (%) of not seeing any other vehicle is 5%. So, we need to find 3 consecutive times without seeing another vehicle for 10 minutes for it to be 30 minutes before we see another one.\nLet the probability of not seeing a vehicle in 10 minutes be P(not10) = P\nTherefore, the probability of not seeing a vehicle in 30 minutes, \nP(not30) = P(not10)*P(not10)*P(not10)= P*P*P = P^3\nGiven that, there is a 95% chance of seeing a vehicle (i.e., 0.95) in 30 minutes:\nWe can find the probability of seeing any other vehicle in the next 30 minutes is,\n1 \u2013 P(not30) = 0.95\n= 1 \u2013 P^3 = 0.95\n=  P^3 = 1 \u2013 0.95 = 0.05\nP = 3\u221a0.05 = 0.3684\nTherefore, the probability of seeing a vehicle in the next 30 minutes is  P = 0.3684\nTherefore, the probability of seeing a vehicle in 10 minutes, = 1- P = 1 \u2013 0.3684 = 0.6315",
        "incorrect answer": ["31.67%", "0.3167"],
        "incorrect explanation": "The probability of not seeing a vehicle within each 10-minute interval is equal. Therefore, the probability of seeing a vehicle in 10 minutes, = 0.95 / 3 = 0.3167"

Both drive back home. One day Ram arrived at the station one hour early and thought of taking a walk back to home. He started walking when after covering a specific distance, he meets with Sita. Both drive back home and this time they reached 30 minutes earlier than the usual time. How long has Ram been walking?\nIt is known that Sita drove every day at a uniform speed.",
        "answer": ["45"],
        "explanation": "Since they reached home 30 minutes earlier, Sita must have saved 15 minutes in each trip i.e., up and down trip, as the speed of the car was uniform.\nThis means that had Sita drove for 15 more minutes, she would have met Ram at the station.\nAs we know Ram arrived at the station at 5 that day, and they must meet at 6, it means that Sita meets Ram at 5:45.\nTherefore, Ram must have walked 45 minutes before meeting Sita.",

        "question": "On an Island, there is an airport that has an unlimited number of identical air-planes. Each air-plane has a fuel capacity to allow it to fly exactly 1/2 way around the world, along a great circle. The planes have the ability to refuel in flight without loss of speed or spillage of fuel. Though the fuel is unlimited, the island is the only source of fuel. You can ignore the time and fuel consumption of refuelling.\nWhat is the minimum number of air-planes required to get one air plane all the way around the world assuming that all of the air planes must return safely to the airport?",
